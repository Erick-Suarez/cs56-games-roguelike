Game runs correctly

Ways to improve the game:
     - Add detail to instructions at the beginning of the game
     - No option to replay game after dying
     - Make it possible to sustain a long game with implemented items
       - note: there are some item classes created but they have not been implemented yet
       

Ways to improve the test files:
     - GamePieceTest.java only tests the constructors of the game pieces
       -note: GamePiece is an interface which is implemented by all classes representing the pieces that show up on the screen (player, monsters, and items)
     - SubMonsterTest.java only tests the constructor, getter, and setter  methods of each of the monster classes that implement GamePiece
     - We can write methods that make sure all the methods of the game pieces work.
