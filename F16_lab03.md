(a) The user controls a character that explores a pitch black room and kills monsters. As the user progresses through the room, the layout of the room is illuminated. The user advances to the next level by slaying all the monsters in a room.

(b) As a player, I can provide directional input to move my character up, down, left, or right.
    As a player, I can move around to illuminate the area around me.
    As a player, I can move into  monsters to attack and kill them.
    As a player, I can move onto the items dropped by monsters to pick them up.

    As a player, I can kill all the monsters in a room in order to advance to the next level.
    As a player, I can take damage until my health total drops to 0, which ends the game.

(c) The software runs very well. There are few obvious bugs. The game generates a menu screen with several options such as "Play," "Instructions," "Highscores," and "Quit." The functionality of "Play" has already been described, and the other options are self explanatory. If the user completes a level, the game generates another one. This continues until the player dies.

(d) As a player, I can explore the map in order to illuminate a relatively complex layout of hallways and smaller rooms.
    As a player, I can engage in turn based combat with monsters through a menu of options such as "Attack" or "Run" in order to fight to the death.
    As a player, I can find weapons and armor to improve my combat capabilities.
    As a player, I can progress through levels to reach boss battles.
    As a player, I can defeat bosses to discover special loot.
