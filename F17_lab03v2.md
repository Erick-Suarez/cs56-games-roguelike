#(a) Description

The game starts with the player being a black room, leaving him/her to explore the cave. The player will find illuminated parts of the cave such as walls and corridors, and will also find monsters, of which the player needs to move on top of to defeat. Once all monsters are defeated in the cave, the player advances to the next level.

#(b) Current User Stories

1. As a player I can move around the cave with the "WASD" keys so that I can explore the cave and kill monsters.

2. As a player I can kill monsters to (if I kill all monsters) proceed to the next level.

3. As a player I can lose all my health to stop playing and get my highscore.

4. As a player I can pick up monster drops by moving onto it to restore my health, decrease my health, or increase my attack power.

5. As a player I can compare my score with previous scores to be more competitive.

6. As a player I can illuminate the cave by exploring the cave to see what the map looks like and where the enemies are.

#(c) Assessment of Status of Software

The software runs. At the main screen you can play the game, look at some instructions, look at high scores, and you can quit the program. The last three are self explanatory. Once you hit play you start at the top left corner of the room, with only a small chunk of the room illuminated where you are. When you move, more of the room becomes illuminated, revealing walls, corridors, and monsters. You can move around freely except you can't go through walls, and you can move on top of monsters to kill them. If they drop items you can pick them up, but the effects are explicitly shown. Once all monsters are killed you move on to the next level starting off how you originall started when you first clicked start, just with harder game settings.
